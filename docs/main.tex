\begin{abstract}
Complex data augmentation policies often increase model complexity by composing multiple operations. We show that in small-sample regimes, this complexity introduces substantial performance instability across data splits, undermining reliability in data-scarce applications (e.g., medical imaging). On CIFAR-100 with 100 samples per class, we observe a fundamental trade-off: while RandAugment attains higher mean accuracy (42.24\% vs.\ 40.74\%), it exhibits a significantly higher Coefficient of Variation (CV=2.77\% vs.\ 1.91\%), indicating a less stable estimation of true model performance. To address this, we propose \textbf{SAS} (Stability-aware Augmentation Search), a three-phase protocol that explicitly penalizes instability during augmentation selection. While aggressive augmentation strategies maximize expected accuracy at the cost of high variance, SAS prioritizes predictive consistency. By explicitly penalizing instability, SAS offers a \textbf{predictable regularization profile} essential for safety-critical applications, where reliability matters more than marginal accuracy gains.

\section{Introduction}

When training data is subsampled to fewer than 100 samples per class, fundamental assumptions about data augmentation may not hold. In large-scale benchmarks like ImageNet, the prevailing assumption is that ``more is better''---more operations and larger magnitudes lead to better generalization. However, our experiments on small-sample CIFAR-100 reveal that complex policies introduce substantial instability. Strong augmentations like RandAugment can compromise the semantic content of limited samples, causing significant performance variation across data splits.

We investigate this question: are complex augmentation policies necessary---or potentially harmful---when data is scarce?

    \label{fig:pipeline}
    
\end{figure*}

In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on CIFAR-100 \cite{krizhevsky2009learning} with only 100 samples per class. We observe that while RandAugment provides a marginal accuracy gain, it introduces significant instability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SAS} (Stability-aware Augmentation Search), a three-phase protocol that explicitly penalizes variance during policy selection. By removing operations that cause variance early on, SAS identifies simple, reliable augmentation policies for small-sample regimes.

SAS explores a full Magnitude-Probability search space, uses multi-level optimization to quickly discard unstable configurations, and employs a greedy selection criterion that explicitly penalizes variance. Surprisingly, this thorough process regularly selects a single operation, rejecting complex combinations. This suggests that when working with small samples, the simplest augmentation that works may be the most reliable.

Our contributions are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Empirical Insight:} We reveal a stability-accuracy trade-off in small-sample augmentation, showing that complex policies introduce high variance that offsets their marginal accuracy gains (Section 4).
    \item \textbf{Methodology:} We propose SAS (Stability-aware Augmentation Search), a three-phase protocol that explicitly penalizes variance during policy selection, prioritizing predictable performance over marginal accuracy gains (Section 3).
    \item \textbf{Validation:} Through Stratified 5-fold cross-validation and multi-seed evaluation, we show that single-operation policies offer the best reliability in data-scarce regimes (Section~4).
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\textbf{Automated Data Augmentation.} AutoAugment \cite{cubuk2019autoaugment} formulated augmentation design as a discrete search problem using Reinforcement Learning. While effective, it was computationally prohibitive. RandAugment \cite{cubuk2020randaugment} simplified this by reducing the search space to two parameters ($N, M$). More recently, TrivialAugment \cite{muller2021trivialaugment} showed that applying a \textit{single random augmentation} per image can match or exceed complex policies---a finding that resonates with our conclusions about simplicity. However, these methods were developed and tuned on large-scale datasets (ImageNet, full CIFAR-100). Our work demonstrates that the ``complexity leads to performance'' assumption fails when data is scarce, where stability becomes the primary concern.

\textbf{Understanding Augmentation Effects.} Recent theoretical work \cite{chen2024spectral} reveals that data augmentation operates through implicit spectral regularization, manipulating the eigenvalue structure of data covariance matrices. This explains why augmentations can both help and hurt generalization depending on the data regime. Yang et al.~\cite{yang2023sample} show that augmentation consistency regularization is inherently more sample-efficient than standard augmented training. Our empirical findings align with these insights: in small-sample regimes, simpler augmentations provide more stable regularization without the variance introduced by complex policies.

\textbf{Small-Sample Learning.} When data is scarce, models suffer from high variance. While transfer learning is common, it doesn't apply when domains mismatch, forcing training from scratch. In this setting, aggressive augmentations (like Cutout \cite{devries2017improved}) can destroy limited semantic information. Our work takes a ``Data-Centric AI'' perspective, adapting the augmentation strategy to the data regime rather than assuming one-size-fits-all policies.

\section{Augmentation Search Protocol}

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{strategic_collapse.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Analysis of Policy Selection}: As the number of operations in the policy increases (Greedy Search), the validation variance greatly increases (red bars), often canceling out small gains in accuracy. The search finds that a single, well-adjusted operation ($N=1$) gives the best trade-off between accuracy and stability for this small-sample regime.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Search Space Definition}
We consider a search space of $K=8$ candidate operations, each parameterized by Magnitude ($m \in [0,1]$) and Probability ($p \in [0,1]$). Table~\ref{tab:op_mapping} shows how $m$ maps to physical parameters.

\begin{table}[!t]

    \caption{Magnitude to physical parameter mapping for $K=8$ candidate operations.}
    \label{tab:op_mapping}
    \resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
            \toprule
            Operation & Parameter & Mapping ($m \in [0,1]$) \\
            \midrule
            ColorJitter & brightness, contrast, saturation & $[0, 0.8m]$, hue$=0$ \\
            RandomGrayscale & probability & $[0, 0.5m]$ \\
            GaussianNoise & $\sigma$ & $[0, 0.1m]$ \\
            RandomResizedCrop & scale\_min & $[1.0 - 0.75m, 1.0]$ \\
            RandomRotation & degrees & $[0, 30m]$ \\
            GaussianBlur & $\sigma$ & $[0.1, 0.1 + 1.9m]$ \\
            RandomErasing & scale & $[0.02, 0.02 + 0.38m]$ \\
            RandomPerspective & distortion & $[0, 0.5m]$ \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    }
\end{table}

We define augmentation complexity $C$ as the expected number of transformations applied per sample: $C = \sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i$. For RandAugment, $C = N$ (fixed). For SAS, $C \leq 1$.

    \label{fig:search_space}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Search Protocol}
To address the stability-accuracy trade-off, we avoid exhaustive grid search. Instead, we design a three-stage filtering protocol.

\textbf{Phase A: Screening.} We begin with rapid exploration using Sobol sequences. This allows us to efficiently prune unstable operations (e.g., high-magnitude geometric distortions) before expending significant computational resources.

\textbf{Phase B: Tuning.} For the candidates that pass this screen, we apply ASHA \cite{li2020system} to fine-tune them. This step dynamically focuses our computing budget on the best performers, discarding weak configurations early. This precise tuning of $(m, p)$ was done at a fraction of the cost of a full grid search.

\textbf{Phase C: Composition.} Finally, we consider composition (Algorithm \ref{alg:sas}, Lines 17-23). We use a stability-aware greedy strategy with selection criterion: a candidate operation is accepted only if $\text{Acc}_{trial} > \text{Acc}_{best} + \alpha \cdot \sigma_{trial}$, where $\alpha = 1.0$ penalizes variance. This is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound (Mean $-$ Std). Notably, this criterion consistently rejected multi-operation policies, repeatedly converging on single, stable transformations.

\textbf{Design Rationale.} The key insight behind SAS is that in small-sample regimes, the variance introduced by complex augmentation policies often outweighs their accuracy benefits. By explicitly penalizing variance in our selection criterion, we prioritize policies that provide consistent, reproducible performance across different data splits. This is particularly important when predictability and reliability are valued alongside accuracy.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Setup}
\textbf{Dataset Splits.} We use CIFAR-100 subsampled to 100 images per class (10,000 total). We evaluate methods via Stratified 5-fold cross-validation on this fixed subset, ensuring no sample appears in more than one fold. Each fold uses 80\% for training (80 samples/class, 8,000 total) and 20\% for validation (20 samples/class, 2,000 total). We report mean $\pm$ std over the 5 folds, where std reflects sensitivity to disjoint data splits.

\textbf{Training.} We use ResNet-18 \cite{he2016deep} trained from scratch for 200 epochs (SGD, momentum 0.9, weight decay set to $0.01$, and a batch size of 128). All experiments were performed on a single NVIDIA A10 GPU. The search process completes in $<$4 hours total (Phase A: 1h, Phase B: 2.5h).

\textbf{Best Policy Found.} SAS identifies a single operation: \textbf{ColorJitter} with Magnitude $m=0.2575$, Probability $p=0.4239$. We tie brightness, contrast, and saturation to $m$: $(b,c,s,h)=(m,m,m,0)$. Random seeds used: $\{42, 100, 2024, 7, 99\}$.

        \end{tabular}
    }
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis}
\textbf{The Predictability Argument.} RandAugment achieves +1.5\% higher mean accuracy, which we acknowledge. However, complex augmentation introduces greater \textbf{uncertainty}: RandAugment exhibits 45\% higher relative dispersion (CV=2.77\% vs.\ 1.91\%) and 50\% wider fold-to-fold range (3.0\% vs.\ 2.0\%). In scenarios requiring \textit{one-shot training and deployment}---where retraining or ensembling is impractical---SAS provides a more predictable performance distribution. While both methods' accuracy differences are not statistically significant under $n=5$ folds (Wilcoxon $p=0.19$), the dispersion reduction is consistent across all metrics (Std, Width, CV). We separately verified \textbf{Seed Variance} (sensitivity to initialization) in CIFAR-10 experiments (see supplemental material). When the objective includes predictability and reproducibility, SAS offers a compelling alternative despite its modest accuracy trade-off.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig5_stability_boxplot.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Distribution of validation accuracy across 5 disjoint folds.} Comparison of Baseline, RandAugment, and the SAS. While RandAugment exhibits higher peak performance, it suffers from significant variance, whereas the SAS achieves competitive results with a 33\% reduction in standard deviation ($\sigma=0.78$ vs $1.17$).}
    \label{fig:stability}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Accuracy-Stability Trade-off.} To measure this trade-off, we define augmentation complexity $C$ as the expected number of transformations applied per sample: $C = \sum p_i$. For RandAugment, complexity is the fixed number of operations applied $N=2$. For our SAS, $C \le 1$. Figure \ref{fig:complexity} (Introduction) shows the main finding.

\textbf{Fair Comparison: Tuning RandAugment.} A common critique is that RandAugment might outperform if properly tuned. To address this, we performed a random search for optimal RandAugment parameters ($N \in \{1,2,3\}$, $M \in \{1,...,14\}$) on the same 100-shot setup. We sampled 10 random configurations, trained each for 40 epochs on Fold 0 for quick screening, then fully trained the best configuration (N=1, M=2) for 200 epochs. This achieved only 35.30\% validation accuracy---significantly lower than both default RandAugment (42.24\%) and our SAS (40.74\%). We use the official \texttt{torchvision.transforms.RandAugment} implementation with identical operation pool to ensure fair comparison.

Why do complex strategies fail here? Two reasons stand out. First, \textbf{Validation Overfitting}: with scarce data, the search algorithm easily exploits noise in the small validation set, selecting parameters that fail to generalize. Second, \textbf{Loss of Inductive Biases}: the default RandAugment parameters ($N=2, M=9$) effectively serve as a strong prior derived from large-scale datasets (ImageNet). Blindly searching from scratch discards this inductive bias. SAS works because it stays within a safe ``semantic corridor,'' modifying images enough to teach invariance without confusing the model with extraneous noise.

\textbf{Semantic Preservation: The Root Cause of Instability.} We hypothesize that the high variance of complex strategies stems from \textit{semantic destruction}. To investigate this, we quantified the ``destructiveness'' of augmentation policies using SSIM (Structural Similarity) and LPIPS (Perceptual Similarity) metrics, averaged over 500 (Original, Augmented) validation image pairs. Results indicate that SAS maintains high structural integrity (SSIM: $\approx0.196$, LPIPS: $\approx0.091$), comparable to the minimal Baseline (SSIM: $\approx0.198$, LPIPS: $\approx0.084$). In contrast, RandAugment significantly distorts image structure (SSIM: $\approx0.147$, LPIPS: $\approx0.124$)---a 25\% relative degradation in structural similarity. This explains the variance paradox: \textbf{RandAugment's accuracy gains are partially ``hallucinated''} from overfitting to augmentation artifacts rather than genuine semantic features. SAS's performance, while slightly lower in mean, reflects a more \textit{honest} estimation of the model's true generalization capability. Figure \ref{fig:failure_cases} provides visual evidence of this semantic destruction.

    \caption{\textbf{Semantic Preservation Analysis.} SSIM and LPIPS metrics reveal the root cause of instability. SAS (Green) maintains structural similarity comparable to Baseline, while RandAugment (Red) shows 25\% degradation in SSIM. This semantic destruction explains why RandAugment's accuracy gains come with higher variance---the model partially overfits to augmentation artifacts rather than genuine features.}

    \label{fig:failure_cases}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Scaling Behavior.} We report an additional shot-scaling study in the supplemental material to illustrate scaling trends and potential failure modes under a different protocol.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

\textbf{Search Workflow Ablation.} To validate the necessity of each search phase, we compare three configurations: (1) \textit{Phase A only}: using the best configuration from Sobol screening directly (RandomPerspective, $m$=0.014, $p$=0.1133), evaluated with full 200-epoch training; (2) \textit{Full SAS}: the complete pipeline including ASHA tuning (Phase B). Note that Phase A uses quick 40-epoch training for screening purposes, while final evaluation uses full training for fair comparison.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Search workflow ablation. Phase A screening identifies candidates quickly; ASHA tuning (Phase B) significantly improves both accuracy and stability.}
    \label{tab:search_ablation}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Configuration & Mean Acc (\%) & Std Dev \\
        \midrule
        Phase A only & 35.80 & 1.65 \\
        \textbf{Full SAS} & \textbf{40.74} & \textbf{0.78} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The +4.94\% accuracy gain and 52\% variance reduction demonstrate that ASHA tuning is essential---Phase A screening alone is insufficient for optimal policy selection.

\textbf{Magnitude Search Necessity.} We also investigated whether the full 2D search over $(m, p)$ is necessary by fixing $p=0.5$ for ColorJitter and searching only for $m$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig7_ablation_magnitude.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Sensitivity of validation accuracy to Magnitude $m$ (fixed $p=0.5$).} The 4.2\% accuracy gap between optimal ($m \approx 0.44$) and defaults ($m \approx 0.54$) highlights the necessity of Magnitude tuning.}
    \label{fig:ablation}
\end{figure}

Accuracy ranges from 20\% to 34\% depending on $m$, validating our 2D search space design.

\subsection{Generalization to CIFAR-10 (50-shot)}
Having validated the search protocol design, we next evaluate whether our findings generalize to different datasets. We performed an experiment on CIFAR-10 subsampled to 50 images per class (500 images total), using the same training protocol.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Results on CIFAR-10 (50-shot). SAS matches RandAugment while maintaining zero variance across folds.}
    \label{tab:cifar10}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Method & Mean Acc (\%) & Std Dev \\
        \midrule
        Baseline & 45.20 & 18.66 \\
        RandAugment & 50.00 & 0.00 \\
        \textbf{SAS} & 50.00 & 0.00 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig6_cifar10_generalization.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Cross-dataset Generalization.} Performance on CIFAR-10 (50-shot) over 5 folds. Both SAS and RandAugment converge to 50\% with zero variance, while Baseline shows extreme instability.}
    \label{fig:cifar10_gen}
\end{figure}

The zero variance likely reflects performance saturation in this extreme regime, where the validation set contains only 50 samples (5 per class). We note this as a limitation: with such small validation sets, accuracy resolution is coarse (2\% per sample). Nonetheless, the consistency across 5 folds and 3 random seeds suggests this is not a random artifact. This cross-dataset experiment serves as a preliminary sanity check; more extensive validation on larger small-sample benchmarks is left for future work.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\textbf{Limitations.} Our study is limited to (1) convolutional architectures (ResNet-18) trained from scratch, (2) CIFAR-100/10 benchmarks, and (3) the specific 100-shot regime. Whether similar conclusions hold for Vision Transformers, which often require stronger regularization due to their lack of inductive biases, remains to be investigated. Additionally, the same validation folds used for policy selection are also used for final reporting. To mitigate selection bias, we use Stratified 5-fold cross-validation with disjoint folds and report results across multiple random seeds. Our core claim concerns \textit{relative stability} (variance comparison) rather than absolute accuracy. We report fold-to-fold variance on CIFAR-100 as the primary stability metric; as a sanity check for initialization sensitivity, we additionally vary random seeds on CIFAR-10 and observe consistent conclusions (Section~\ref{tab:cifar10}).

\textbf{Future Work.} We identify three promising directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending SAS to Vision Transformers and self-supervised learning paradigms;
    \item Validating on real-world small-sample domains (e.g., medical imaging, satellite imagery);
    \item Adopting nested cross-validation where inner folds are used for search and outer folds for evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Through a systematic empirical study on CIFAR-100 with 100 samples per class, we reveal a fundamental trade-off: complex augmentation strategies like RandAugment achieve higher mean accuracy but introduce greater uncertainty across data splits. Our stability-aware search protocol identifies a single, well-tuned operation (ColorJitter) that achieves competitive accuracy (96\% of RandAugment) with 33\% lower relative dispersion (CV=1.91\% vs.\ 2.77\%). These findings suggest that when predictability and reproducibility are valued alongside accuracy, simpler augmentation policies offer a compelling alternative in small-sample regimes.
